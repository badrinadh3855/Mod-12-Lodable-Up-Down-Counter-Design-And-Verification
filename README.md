# Mod-12-Up-Down-Counter-Design-And-Verification
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a modulo-12 up-down counter using SystemVerilog. The counter can count up or down based on a control signal and resets upon reaching its limit (0 to 11). The design ensures robust functionality, covering all states and transitions.
